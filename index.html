    <h3>Welcome!!!</h3>
    <p>Over 10 years ago, I had a dream of making my delicious Salmon Cookies the talk of the town. I never imagined they would become an instant classic of Washington! These high-protein snacks are all made with real, wild-caught salmon, and made locally here in Washington for ideal taste and freshness. Whether you are visiting from out of town, or just trying to fuel up for a work day, come to one of our 5 locations and chow down on one of Pat's Salmon Cookies!</p>
